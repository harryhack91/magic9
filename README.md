Magic9 GUI Tool
===
Initial Draft
---

This is still a WIP on an very early stage, not even an alpha, because the application is not functional yet. However, I have decided to publish this code to this repository for backup purposes. I did it because I have put a lot of effort and time to it and I just don't want to loose it accidentally.

Additionally, I think it's a good idea to start tracking the changes right now, before the application become more complex. 

What will this software do?
---

This will be a graphical interface to automate the process of preparing an SD card for the installation of [arm9loaderhax](https://github.com/AuroraWright/arm9loaderhax) based on the instructions of [3ds.guide](http://3ds.guide). 

It will also automate the download of the required resources, this isn't implemented yet but I plan to do it as soon as possible. Of course the GUI hasn't been implemented either.

The functionality of the SD card preparation is nearly complete and there are a few tests but ideally we need more and they need to be improved as well.

I will be quite busy until 17th of February (except weekends) but I will try to work on this as much as possible.
